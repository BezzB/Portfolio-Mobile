                  I code every day with fellow developers around the globe, learning the vital skills of communication and teamwork.
                  
                  Additionally, my previous Education degree has instilled discipline, perseverance, and the ability to complete a course. 
                  I completed my degree and am confident I can complete any software development job assigned to me.
